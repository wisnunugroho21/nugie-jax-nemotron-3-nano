Minimal Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in JAX/Flax NNX.

Based on Nemotron 3 Nano (arXiv:2512.20848, §2.1).

Key design choices from the paper:

1. Granular routed experts (DeepSeekMoE style, Dai et al. 2024):
   Each "base" expert is split into finer-grained smaller experts.
   Total routed experts = num_experts * granularity_factor,
   each with hidden_dim = expert_hidden_dim / granularity_factor.
   This improves expert specialization without changing total parameter count.

2. Shared experts:
   Always-on FFN experts that run for every token, unconditionally.
   They provide a stable shared capacity outside of routing competition.
   Shared experts keep the full expert_hidden_dim.

3. Sigmoid gating (Nemotron-specific, unlike most MoE models that use softmax):
   Gate scores are produced independently per expert via sigmoid.
   This means experts do NOT compete with each other for probability mass.
   After top-k selection, selected scores are renormalized to sum to 1
   so that the combined output has a stable scale.

4. Squared-ReLU activation inside each expert FFN:
   relu(x)^2 — a stronger nonlinearity than plain ReLU.

5. Aux-loss-free load balancing (Wang et al. 2024, as used in Nemotron 3 Nano §2.4):
   Instead of an auxiliary gradient loss, each expert gets a learnable bias term.
   The bias is added to routing scores at selection time, nudging the router toward
   under-utilized experts — WITHOUT affecting the actual output gate weights.
   After each training step, biases are updated with a simple sign rule:
     if expert i got too many tokens → decrease its bias (harder to pick next time)
     if expert i got too few tokens  → increase its bias (easier to pick next time)
   The update rate is 1e-3 per the paper. This produces no extra gradient computation.

6. No bias on any linear layers (per paper).

The implementation is explicit and loop-based for readability, not performance.

    Sparse MoE layer matching the Nemotron 3 Nano design (arXiv:2512.20848, §2.1).

    --- Granular experts (DeepSeekMoE style) ---
    Instead of a few large experts, we use many small, fine-grained experts.
    Given `num_experts` base experts and a `granularity_factor` g:
      - Actual routed expert count = num_experts * g
      - Each routed expert hidden dim = expert_hidden_dim / g
      - Top-k = top_k * g   (if scale_top_k_with_granularity=True)
    Total FLOPs per token stays the same, but with more diverse expert paths.
    In Nemotron 3 Nano: 128 total routable experts, 6 activated per token.

    --- Shared experts ---
    `num_shared_experts` always-on FFN experts run on every token.
    They are NOT subject to routing — they always contribute to the output.
    Their outputs are summed and added to the routed path output.
    Shared experts keep the full expert_hidden_dim (not reduced by granularity).
    In Nemotron 3 Nano: 2 shared experts.

    --- Sigmoid routing (Nemotron-specific) ---
    Router logits -> sigmoid -> top-k selection.
    With softmax (most MoEs): experts compete; picking one raises another's cost.
    With sigmoid: scores are independent; each expert is scored on its own merit.
    After top-k, selected scores are renormalized to sum to 1 for stable output scale.

    --- Aux-loss-free load balancing ---
    Without any balancing, the router collapses: it always picks a few favourite
    experts and ignores the rest. The fix used in Nemotron 3 Nano is NOT a loss
    term — instead, each expert gets a persistent bias scalar.

    At routing time: top-k uses (sigmoid_score + expert_bias) to decide which
    experts to activate. A higher bias makes an expert easier to pick.

    At output time: gate weights use the ORIGINAL sigmoid scores (without bias),
    so the learned expert magnitudes are preserved.

    After every training step (outside the gradient): biases are nudged with a
    simple sign update. Overloaded experts get a smaller bias; underloaded ones
    get a larger bias. Over time this pushes the router toward balance.

        step size is always exactly +/- bias_update_rate regardless of how far
        off-balance the expert is. This keeps the bias values small and stable.

        IMPORTANT: Call this AFTER the optimizer step, outside the gradient tape.
