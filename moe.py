Minimal Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in JAX/Flax NNX.

Based on Nemotron 3 Nano (arXiv:2512.20848, §2.1).

Key design choices from the paper:

1. Granular routed experts (DeepSeekMoE style, Dai et al. 2024):
   Each "base" expert is split into finer-grained smaller experts.
   Total routed experts = num_experts * granularity_factor,
   each with hidden_dim = expert_hidden_dim / granularity_factor.
   This improves expert specialization without changing total parameter count.

2. Shared experts:
   Always-on FFN experts that run for every token, unconditionally.
   They provide a stable shared capacity outside of routing competition.
   Shared experts keep the full expert_hidden_dim.

3. Sigmoid gating (Nemotron-specific, unlike most MoE models that use softmax):
   Gate scores are produced independently per expert via sigmoid.
   This means experts do NOT compete with each other for probability mass.
   After top-k selection, selected scores are renormalized to sum to 1
   so that the combined output has a stable scale.

4. Squared-ReLU activation inside each expert FFN:
   relu(x)^2 — a stronger nonlinearity than plain ReLU.

5. Aux-loss-free load balancing (Wang et al. 2024, as used in Nemotron 3 Nano §2.4):
   Instead of an auxiliary gradient loss, each expert gets a learnable bias term.
   The bias is added to routing scores at selection time, nudging the router toward
   under-utilized experts — WITHOUT affecting the actual output gate weights.
   After each training step, biases are updated with a simple sign rule:
     if expert i got too many tokens → decrease its bias (harder to pick next time)
     if expert i got too few tokens  → increase its bias (easier to pick next time)
   The update rate is 1e-3 per the paper. This produces no extra gradient computation.

6. No bias on any linear layers (per paper).

The implementation is explicit and loop-based for readability, not performance.

    Sparse MoE layer matching the Nemotron 3 Nano design (arXiv:2512.20848, §2.1).

    --- Granular experts (DeepSeekMoE style) ---
    Instead of a few large experts, we use many small, fine-grained experts.
    Given `num_experts` base experts and a `granularity_factor` g:
      - Actual routed expert count = num_experts * g
      - Each routed expert hidden dim = expert_hidden_dim / g
      - Top-k = top_k * g   (if scale_top_k_with_granularity=True)
    Total FLOPs per token stays the same, but with more diverse expert paths.
    In Nemotron 3 Nano: 128 total routable experts, 6 activated per token.

    --- Shared experts ---
    `num_shared_experts` always-on FFN experts run on every token.
    They are NOT subject to routing — they always contribute to the output.
    Their outputs are summed and added to the routed path output.
    Shared experts keep the full expert_hidden_dim (not reduced by granularity).
    In Nemotron 3 Nano: 2 shared experts.

    LRM note on expert specialization: After training on diverse reasoning data
    (math, science, code, puzzles), MoE experts tend to naturally specialize.
    Some routed experts activate more on mathematical derivation steps, others
    on code generation, others on natural language reasoning. The sparse top-k
    routing learns this specialization automatically — no explicit labels or
    constraints are needed. The shared experts, being always-on, tend to capture
    universal reasoning patterns that appear in every domain: "let me break this
    problem into steps", checking intermediate results, or restating the problem.
    This specialization is one reason why MoE is particularly useful for LRM —
    a single dense FFN must handle all reasoning types in a single weight matrix.

    --- Sigmoid routing (Nemotron-specific) ---
    Router logits -> sigmoid -> top-k selection.
    With softmax (most MoEs): experts compete; picking one raises another's cost.
    With sigmoid: scores are independent; each expert is scored on its own merit.
    After top-k, selected scores are renormalized to sum to 1 for stable output scale.

    --- Aux-loss-free load balancing ---
    Without any balancing, the router collapses: it always picks a few favourite
    experts and ignores the rest. The fix used in Nemotron 3 Nano is NOT a loss
    term — instead, each expert gets a persistent bias scalar.

    At routing time: top-k uses (sigmoid_score + expert_bias) to decide which
    experts to activate. A higher bias makes an expert easier to pick.

    At output time: gate weights use the ORIGINAL sigmoid scores (without bias),
    so the learned expert magnitudes are preserved.

    After every training step (outside the gradient): biases are nudged with a
    simple sign update. Overloaded experts get a smaller bias; underloaded ones
    get a larger bias. Over time this pushes the router toward balance.

    Args:
        granularity_factor:
            1 = standard MoE (no granularity).
            >1 = each base expert is split into this many smaller experts.
        scale_top_k_with_granularity:
            True (default): effective top-k = top_k * granularity_factor.
            False: keep top-k fixed regardless of granularity.
        bias_update_rate:
            Step size for the expert bias update. 1e-3 per Nemotron 3 Nano §2.4.
